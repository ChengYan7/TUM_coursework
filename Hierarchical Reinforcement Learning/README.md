# Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Feudal Hierarchy)
A not-so-awesome list of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning , inspired by [Awesome Computer Vision](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision).
This list does not aim to be exhaustive, instead of some freewheeling coursework notes. 
## Introduction
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) decomposes a long-horizon reinforcement learning task into a hierarchy of sub-tasks such that a higher-level policy learns to perform the task by choosing optimal sub-tasks as the higher-level actions. 

The hierarchical reinforcement learning approach of feudal hierarchy is one of the popular methods for learning hierarchical policy. 
In feudal hierarchy, the action space of a higher-level policy consists of sub-goals corresponding to various sub-tasks and the sub-goal chosen by the higher-level policy is taken as input by a policy at the lower-level.
